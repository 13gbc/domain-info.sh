# Examining DNS Records with a Bash Script or Two

A domain's DNS records are important for determining how the domain functions and how it can be accessed on the internet. Some of the key DNS records for a domain include the NS (name server) records, which determine which DNS servers are responsible for the domain's DNS records; the MX (mail exchange) records, which determine which servers are responsible for handling email for the domain; the SOA (start of authority) record, which provides information about the domain's DNS configuration; and the www record, which determines the IP address or hostname of the web server that serves the domain's website.

This repository will provide a bunch of scripts to make life easier when dealing with DNS at work !
